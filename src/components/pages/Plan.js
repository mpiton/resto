				<h1>Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.</h1>
<p>Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</p>
<p>Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. What!? Hey, Luke! <strong> May the Force be with you.</strong> <em> A tremor in the Force.</em> The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</p>
<h2>Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.</h2>
<p>As you wish. Ye-ha! I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</p>
<ol>
<li>But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?</li><li>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</li><li>I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</li>
